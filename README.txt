Hello, and welcome to my first attempt at creating a brilliant, new webpage. I have just barely started scratching the surface of multiple languages such as HTML, JavaScript, and PHP to name a few and this is the first webpage I've built now mostly understanding just HTML. I'm still in the process of learning PHP and JavaScript, but I'll be more into that as soon as I have time to finish learning them. 

This project is an ongoing contest of my with my friend over at mars11.com to build a better website. He is way ahead of me and knows all these languages and is even a web developer over at elementary. He challenge me and I accepted. So now, on my honor, I must simply build a webpage to rival his and no one will win until one of us drops dead from all this coding. 

Here is the very basic knowledge of HTML I have. I hope to get better soon, as my website is kind of embarassing next to his (mars11.com). I hope you like it and will support me.
